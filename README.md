# Shiny Map and Stats

## Description

The purpose of the codebase is to create various visualizations using `R`, the `shiny` package, and various other supporting libraries for demonstration purposes.

## How to Run

First, ensure all the necessary packages are installed on the machine.

If the project is opened with RStudio, the program will give the option to run the application.

If using the `R` command line, ensure `shiny` is loaded using `library(shiny)` and run `runApp("dir)`, where `dir` is the directory the project exists in.
